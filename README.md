This is a T-Shirt.  It has an Apache attack helicopter on it and the word entity wrote in an obtuse font.  There is only one design, one T, and one colour.  

However, the design is open source and as a result, forks can be submitted, anyone. 

If you feel you can improve the T simply submit your design and the owners of the T will vote on if this becomes the new design or not. If consensus is achieved then the new design will become the only design available.
